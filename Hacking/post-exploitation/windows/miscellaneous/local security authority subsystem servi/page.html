<title>Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)</title>
</head><body><span style="font-size: 14pt">lsass.exeÂ is the process that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on Windows systems.<br/>
<br/>
When a user attempts to log on to the system, <br/>
this process verifies their log on attempt and creates access tokens based on the user's permission levels.<br/>
<br/>
LSASS is also responsible for <b>user account password changes.</b><br/>
All events associated with this process <b>(logon/logoff attempts, etc.)</b>&nbsp;are logged within the <b>Windows Security Log.</b><br/>
LSASS is an extremely high-value target<br/>
as <b>several tools exist to extract both cleartext and hashed credentials stored in memory by this process.</b></span></body></html>
