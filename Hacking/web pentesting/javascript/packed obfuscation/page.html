<title>Packed Obfuscation</title>
</head><body><div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: neue-haas-unica"><span style="font-size: 14pt">A packer obfuscation tool usually attempts to convert all words and symbols of the code into a list or a dictionary<br/>
and then refer to them using the (p,a,c,k,e,d) function to re-build the original code during execution.<br/>
The (p,a,c,k,e,d) can be different from one packer to another.<br/>
However, it usually contains a certain order in which the words and symbols<br/>
of the original code were packed to know how to order them during execution.<br/>
</span></span></div><span style="font-size: 14pt"><br/>
<span style="font-family: neue-haas-unica"><div style="text-align: left">While a packer does a great job reducing the code's readability, we can still see its main strings written<br/>
in cleartext, which may reveal some of its functionality.<br/>
This is why we may want to look for better ways to obfuscate our code.<br/>

<span style="font-family: neue-haas-unica"><div style="text-align: left">In the next section, we will try another tool to make it more obfuscated.<br/>
