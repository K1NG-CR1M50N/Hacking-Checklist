<span style="font-size: 15pt">As a pentester, you will probably see only the <b>Before You Test and After You Test<br/>
</b><b><br/>
<span style="color: #0000ff"><u>Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA, can be Mutual):</u></span><br/>
</b>The document says that you are not able to disclosure what you will find with<br/>
other people, the same goes with them if it ise mutual<br/>
<br/>
Some clients can ask you to sign that even for their first talk<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b><u><span style="color: #0000ff">Master Service Agreement (MSA) &amp; Statement of Work (SOW):</span></u><br/>
</b>MSA is going to specify the objectives and responsibilities of both parties<br/>
<br/>
In SOW you will talk about activities, deliverable, timelines, how pay is going to pay etc.<br/>
(E.G. "We will do a Wireless Pentent, we are going to take 10 days, we will send you a report<br/>
in the end and it will cost 5k money")<br/>
</span><br/>
<span style="font-size: 15pt">The MSA is for multiple contracts, SOW is for a single contract</span><br/>
